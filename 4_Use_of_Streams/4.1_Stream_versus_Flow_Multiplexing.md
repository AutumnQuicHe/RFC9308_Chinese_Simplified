Streams are meaningful only to the application; since stream information is carried inside QUIC's encryption boundary, a given packet exposes no information about which stream(s) are carried within the packet. Therefore, stream multiplexing is not intended to be used for differentiating streams in terms of network treatment. Application traffic requiring different network treatment should therefore be carried over different 5-tuples (i.e., multiple QUIC connections). Given QUIC's ability to send application data in the first RTT of a connection (if a previous connection to the same host has been successfully established to provide the necessary credentials), the cost of establishing another connection is extremely low.
