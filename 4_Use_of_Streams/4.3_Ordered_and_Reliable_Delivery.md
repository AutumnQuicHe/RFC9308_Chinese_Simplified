QUIC streams enable ordered and reliable delivery. Though it is possible for an implementation to provide options that use streams for partial reliability or out-of-order delivery, most implementations will assume that data is reliably delivered in order.

QUIC流支持有序且可靠的交付。
尽管实现有可能提供将流用于乱序的或部分可靠的交付的选项，但是绝大多数实现都假设数据是可靠且有序地送达的。

Under this assumption, an endpoint that receives stream data might not make forward progress until data that is contiguous with the start of a stream is available. In particular, a receiver might withhold flow control credit until contiguous data is delivered to the application; see Section 2.2 of [QUIC]. To support this receive logic, an endpoint will send stream data until it is acknowledged, ensuring that data at the start of the stream is sent and acknowledged first.

基于该假设，终端接收流数据的进度或许只有在与流的起始位置接续的数据抵达后才会有所进展。
需要强调的是，接收方可能只有在接续数据被交付给应用后才释放流量控制额度；详见《[QUIC](../RFC9000_Chinese_Simplified)》的[第2.2章](../RFC9000_Chinese_Simplified/#2.2_Sending_and_Receiving_Data)。
为了支持该接收逻辑，终端在数据得到确认前不会中断流数据的发送，确保流起始位置的数据首先得到发送和确认。

An endpoint that uses a different sending behavior and does not negotiate that change with its peer might encounter performance issues or deadlocks.

使用了其他的发送行为，又没有与对端协商此变更的终端可能遇到性能问题或死锁。
