Stream prioritization is not exposed to either the network or the receiver. Prioritization is managed by the sender, and the QUIC transport should provide an interface for applications to prioritize streams [QUIC]. Applications can implement their own prioritization scheme on top of QUIC: an application protocol that runs on top of QUIC can define explicit messages for signaling priority, such as those defined in [RFC9218] for HTTP. An application protocol can define rules that allow an endpoint to determine priority based on context or can provide a higher-level interface and leave the determination to the application on top.

流的优先级既没有暴露给网络也没有暴露给接收方。优先级是由发送方控制的，同时QUIC传输层应该向应用提供接口来为流设置优先级（详见《[QUIC](../RFC9000_Chinese_Simplified)》）。应用可以基于QUIC实现它们自己的优先级方案：运行于QUIC之上的应用协议可以定义明确的用于标记优先级的消息，例如在《[RFC9218](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9218)》中为HTTP定义的那些消息。应用协议可以定义允许终端根据上下文来决定优先级的规则，或提供上层接口并交给上层应用来判断。

Priority handling of retransmissions can be implemented by the sender in the transport layer. [QUIC] recommends retransmitting lost data before new data, unless indicated differently by the application. When a QUIC endpoint uses fully reliable streams for transmission, prioritization of retransmissions will be beneficial in most cases, filling in gaps and freeing up the flow control window. For partially reliable or unreliable streams, priority scheduling of retransmissions over data of higher-priority streams might not be desirable. For such streams, QUIC could either provide an explicit interface to control prioritization or derive the prioritization decision from the reliability level of the stream.

重传行为的优先级处理可以由发送方在传输层实现。《[QUIC](../RFC9000_Chinese_Simplified)》推荐在发送新数据前重传丢失的数据，除非受到应用的特别指定。当QUIC终端使用完全可靠的流来传输数据时，重传的优先化将在大多数场景中有所裨益，既能填补数据空缺又能释放流量控制窗口。对于不可靠或部分可靠的流，可能不希望将重传的优先级设置到高于其他高优先级的流数据。对于这些流，QUIC可以要么提供明确的控制优先级的接口，要么基于流的可靠度来决定优先级。
