QUIC flow control (Section 4 of [QUIC]) provides a means of managing access to the limited buffers that endpoints have for incoming data. This mechanism limits the amount of data that can be in buffers in endpoints or in transit on the network. However, there are several ways in which limits can produce conditions that can cause a connection to either perform suboptimally or become deadlocked.

QUIC的流量控制机制（详见《[QUIC](../RFC9000_Chinese_Simplified)》的[第4章](../RFC9000_Chinese_Simplified/#4_Flow_Control)）提供了一种途径来控制终端为传入数据准备的有限缓存的访问权限。这项机制限制了能够存在于终端的缓存或网络线路中的数据量。然而，这种限制在某些情况下可能使得连接低效运行或遇到死锁。

Deadlocks in flow control are possible for any protocol that uses QUIC, though whether they become a problem depends on how implementations consume data and provide flow control credit. Understanding what causes deadlocking might help implementations avoid deadlocks.

流量控制中的死锁在任何使用QUIC的协议中都有可能出现，不过它们是否会发展为严重问题取决于实现消耗数据和提供流量控制额度的方式。把握住死锁产生的原因或许能帮助实现避免死锁。

The size and rate of updates to flow control credit can affect performance. Applications that use QUIC often have a data consumer that reads data from transport buffers. Some implementations might have independent receive buffers at the transport layer and application layer. Consuming data does not always imply it is immediately processed. However, a common implementation technique is to extend flow control credit to the sender by emitting MAX_DATA and/or MAX_STREAM_DATA frames as data is consumed. Delivery of these frames is affected by the latency of the back channel from the receiver to the data sender. If credit is not extended in a timely manner, the sending application can be blocked, effectively throttling the sender.

流量控制额度的尺寸和更新速率会影响性能。使用QUIC的应用经常具有一个从传输层缓存中读取数据的数据消费器。一些实现可能在传输层和应用层准备了独立的接收缓存。数据的消费并不总是意味着数据立即得到了处理。然而，一种常见的实现技巧是通过随数据消费而发送**最大数据量帧**和/或**最大流数据量帧**的方式来将流量控制额度的扩充告知发送方。这些帧的交付受到从接收方至数据发送方这一反向信道的延迟影响。如果没有及时扩充额度，那么正在发送的应用会受到阻塞，严重限制发送速率。

Large application messages can produce deadlocking if the recipient does not read data from the transport incrementally. If the message is larger than the flow control credit available and the recipient does not release additional flow control credit until the entire message is received and delivered, a deadlock can occur. This is possible even where stream flow control limits are not reached because connection flow control limits can be consumed by other streams.

如果接收方没有逐渐从传输层读取数据，那么较大的应用消息可能带来死锁。如果消息尺寸大于可用的流量控制额度，且接收方只有在接收到并交付完整消息后才释放额外的流量控制额度，那么死锁就会发生。即使没有触及流的流量控制上限，这种情况也有可能发生，因为其他流会来消费连接的流量控制额度。

A length-prefixed message format makes it easier for a data consumer to leave data unread in the transport buffer and thereby withhold flow control credit. If flow control limits prevent the remainder of a message from being sent, a deadlock will result. A length prefix might also enable the detection of this sort of deadlock. Where application protocols have messages that might be processed as a single unit, reserving flow control credit for the entire message atomically makes this style of deadlock less likely.

具有长度前缀的消息格式使得数据消费器更容易在传输层缓存中遗留数据并扣留流量控制额度。如果流量控制的限制阻止了消息剩余部分的发送，那么就会造成死锁。长度前缀或许有助于检测此类死锁。当应用协议中存在可能必须作为一个单元来处理的消息时，为整条消息保留足够的流量控制额度能使得此类死锁更不容易出现。

A data consumer can eagerly read all data as it becomes available in order to make the receiver extend flow control credit and reduce the chances of a deadlock. However, such a data consumer might need other means for holding a peer accountable for the additional state it keeps for partially processed messages.

数据消费器可以主动读取所有可用数据从而使得接收方扩充流量控制额度并降低发生死锁的可能性。然而，这样的数据消费器或许需要额外的方法，让对端对其为部分处理的消息维持的额外状态负起责任。

Deadlocking can also occur if data on different streams is interdependent. Suppose that data on one stream arrives before the data on a second stream on which it depends. A deadlock can occur if the first stream is left unread, preventing the receiver from extending flow control credit for the second stream. To reduce the likelihood of deadlock for interdependent data, the sender should ensure that dependent data is not sent until the data it depends on has been accounted for in both stream- and connection-level flow control credit.

死锁还有可能在不同流上的数据具有依赖时发生。假设某条流上的数据比另一条流上的数据先抵达，且前者依赖后者。如果前者的流保持未读状态，那么就会阻止接收方为后者的流扩充流量控制额度。为了降低死锁因为数据依赖而发生的可能性，发送方应该确保只有在为被依赖的数据恢复流级和连接级的流量控制额度后才发送依赖它的数据。

Some deadlocking scenarios might be resolved by canceling affected streams with STOP_SENDING or RESET_STREAM. Canceling some streams results in the connection being terminated in some protocols.

或许可以通过用**停止发送帧**或**流重置帧**取消受影响的流的方式来解决一些死锁场景。在某些协议中，取消某些流会引发连接的终止。
