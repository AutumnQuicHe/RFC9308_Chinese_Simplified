QUIC endpoints are responsible for communicating the cumulative limit of streams they would allow to be opened by their peer. Initial limits are advertised using the initial_max_streams_bidi and initial_max_streams_uni transport parameters. As streams are opened and closed, they are consumed, and the cumulative total is incremented. Limits can be increased using the MAX_STREAMS frame, but there is no mechanism to reduce limits. Once stream limits are reached, no more streams can be opened, which prevents applications using QUIC from making further progress. At this stage, connections can be terminated via idle timeout or explicit close; see Section 10.

QUIC终端有义务宣告它允许对端打开的流的累计总数。初始的限制值是通过传输参数`initial_max_streams_bidi`和`initial_max_streams_uni`来宣告的。随着流的打开与关闭，会消耗可用的流数量，而累计总数会上升。限制值可以使用**最大流帧**来提高，但是不存在降低限制值的机制。一旦触及流上限，就不能再打开任何流，这会阻止QUIC应用继续通信。在这个阶段，可以通过空闲超时或主动关闭的方式来终止连接；详见[第10章](#10_Connection_Termination)。

An application that uses QUIC and communicates a cumulative stream limit might require the connection to be closed before the limit is reached, e.g., to stop the server in order to perform scheduled maintenance. Immediate connection close causes abrupt closure of actively used streams. Depending on how an application uses QUIC streams, this could be undesirable or detrimental to behavior or performance.

为了，比如说，停止服务器来开展例行维护，使用QUIC并告知累计流数上限的应用可能需要连接在触及流数上限前就被关闭。连接的立即关闭会造成正在活跃的流被强行关闭。取决于应用使用QUIC流的方式，这种后果可能是不想要的或对应用行为和性能有害的。

A more graceful closure technique is to stop sending increases to stream limits and allow the connection to naturally terminate once remaining streams are consumed. However, the period of time it takes to do so is dependent on the peer, and an unpredictable closing period might not fit application or operational needs. Applications using QUIC can be conservative with open stream limits in order to reduce the commitment and indeterminism. However, being overly conservative with stream limits affects stream concurrency. Balancing these aspects can be specific to applications and their deployments.

一种更加优雅的关闭技巧是停止提高流数量限制，令连接在消耗完已打开的流后自然地终止。然而，这个过程所需的时间取决于对端，且不确定的关闭耗时可能满足不了应用或操作上的需要。使用QUIC的应用可以在开放流数量上表现得保守一些，以降低承诺与不确定性。不过，表现得过于保守则会影响流的并发。在这些方面的权衡方式可以是特定于应用及其部署的。

Instead of relying on stream limits to avoid abrupt closure, an application layer's graceful close mechanism can be used to communicate the intention to explicitly close the connection at some future point. HTTP/3 provides such a mechanism using the GOAWAY frame. In HTTP/3, when the GOAWAY frame is received by a client, it stops opening new streams even if the cumulative stream limit would allow. Instead, the client would create a new connection on which to open further streams. Once all streams are closed on the old connection, it can be terminated safely by a connection close or after expiration of the idle timeout (see Section 10).

可以使用应用层的优雅关闭机制来明确表达在将来的某个时间点关闭连接的意图，而不是依靠流数量限制来避免强行关闭。利用**关闭帧**，HTTP/3提供了该机制。在HTTP/3中，当客户端接收到**关闭帧**时，即便累计流数量允许，它也会停止打开新的流。相反，客户端将创建一条新连接，并在新连接上打开后续的流。一旦旧连接上的所有流都被关闭，就能通过连接关闭的途径或经过空闲超时时长之后再安全地关闭所有流（详见[第10章](#10_Connection_Termination)）。
