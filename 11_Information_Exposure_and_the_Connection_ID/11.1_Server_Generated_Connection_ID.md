QUIC supports a server-generated connection ID that is transmitted to the client during connection establishment (see Section 7.2 of [QUIC]). Servers behind load balancers may need to change the connection ID during the handshake, encoding the identity of the server or information about its load balancing pool, in order to support stateless load balancing.

QUIC支持使用由服务器创建的连接ID，它是在连接建立期间发送给客户端的（详见《[QUIC]()》的[第7.2章]()）。在负载均衡器后方的服务器可能需要在握手期间更改连接ID，将服务器身份或其负载均衡池的信息编码进去，从而支持无状态的负载均衡。

Server deployments with load balancers and other routing infrastructure need to ensure that this infrastructure consistently routes packets to the server instance that has the connection state, even if addresses, ports, or connection IDs change. This might require coordination between servers and infrastructure. One method of achieving this involves encoding routing information into the connection ID. For an example of this technique, see [QUIC-LB].

启用了负载均衡器或其他路由基础设置的服务器部署需要确保即使地址、端口，以及连接ID发生变化，该基础设施也能将数据包稳定地路由至具有连接状态的服务器实例。这可能需要服务器与基础设施的协作。为了做到这一点，一种方法是将路由信息编码进连接ID中。有关此技巧的样例，详见《[QUIC-LB]()》。
