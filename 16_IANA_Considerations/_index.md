This document has no actions for IANA; however, note that Section 8 recommends that an application that has already registered a TCP port but wants to specify QUIC as a transport should register a UDP port analogous to their existing TCP registration.

本文档没有与IANA相关的操作；不过，注意[第8章]()中推荐已经注册了TCP端口但还想要将QUIC用作传输方式的应用应该去注册一个与其TCP注册项一致的UDP端口。
